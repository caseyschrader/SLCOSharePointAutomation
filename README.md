# SLCOSharePointAutomation

These scripts were used in the automation of updating points within the county's SharePoint control library. The sharepoint_date_updater script was created to update incorrect dates within 2200+ point history files while the point_history_updater was created for future point history file uploads.

The specific base urls and paths were originally hardcoded but have been changed before pushing onto github.
